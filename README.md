# EzypayProject

This repository describe a design of an end-to-end BI solution for Ezypay assignment. I have used Microsoft Power BI dataflows (online service) and Microsoft Power BI Desktop to do this assessment. I have documented my proposed design in Microsoft Word as you can find in this repository. However, the Diagrams in this report are generated by Microsoft Power BI dataflows (online service), Microsoft Power BI Desktop, and online drawing tool (app.terrastruct.com).

# Assumption:
I assume that the data from SQL Server and Postgre SQL is a query that is collected through various tables in those databases and then placed into one single table through multiple columns daily basis. Therefore,  I assume that data records are shows the number of customers of each business entity for every single date.
